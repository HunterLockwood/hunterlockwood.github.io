# A Cold Rush of Blood to the Head

This is the album that came after *Parachutes*, which contains the song "Yellow".

## God Put a Smile Upon Your Face

[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine


## In My Place

[Verse 1]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it

## Politik

[Verse 1]
Look at Earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik
