# Personal Website Repo

These are the files for my personal website.

This is `the-scientist` branch, because I am changing it over to [`yellow`](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/) (get it?).

## Everyone must find a place

`hunterlockwood.github.io` is built using the `yellow.php` extension [`generate`](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-generate).

Note that `yellow-system.ini` must be set correctly:

```shell
> php yellow.php generate
> ERROR generating files: Please configure GenerateStaticUrl in file 'system/extensions/yellow-system.ini'!
```
