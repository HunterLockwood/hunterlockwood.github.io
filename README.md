## What Next?

- add something like a [tech/uses page](https://uses.tech/) and/or [colophon](https://indieweb.org/colophon) 
- add [sidenotes](https://gwern.net/sidenote)
    - trying to figure out the best solution for this still
- export posts from tumblr, to get [off the silos](https://indieweb.org/export#Silos)
- [add a map](https://github.com/GiovanniSalmeri/yellow-openstreetmap) of some miami places

## Adding a Miami-Illinois Mode?

Started looking at the `yellow-language.ini` and realizing a big chunk of what I'm doing could be easily translated to Miami-Illinois...

```ini

Language: mia
LanguageLocale: mia_STD
LanguageDescription: Miami-Illinois, Modern Standard
LanguageTranslator: Dr. Hunter Thompson Lockwood
