<p>I work in the Language Research Office at <a href="https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/">The Myaamia Center</a> under <a href="https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/about/staff-faculty-affiliates/costa/index.html">Dr. David Costa</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My focus for many years has been to <strong>contribute to the documentation &amp; reclamation of Algonquian languages, especially Miami-Illinois &amp; Ojibwe-Potawatomi</strong>.</p>

<p>As a part of the <strong>Language Research Office at <a href="https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/index.html">The Myaamia Center</a></strong>, I work in Oxford, Ohio, to support the <strong>Miami Tribe of Oklahoma</strong> in their efforts to revitalize their language. Recently, much of the public-facing scholarship I do can be considered <em>digital philology</em>, in that I work with textual sources. <a href="/about/selected-writings.html">Check out some of my work</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Less visibly, I work closely with the other Offices at the Center, supporting the <a href="https://aacimotaatiiyankwi.org/education/programming/">pedagogical &amp; educational efforts</a> of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and <a href="https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/research/digital-resources/index.html">the software development team</a>, who is responsible for the <a href="https://ilaatawaakani.org">Indigenous Languages Digital Archive</a> (ILDA) and other digital resources.</p>

<h2 id="algonquian-language-documentation-for-language-reclamation">Algonquian Language Documentation for Language Reclamation</h2>

<p>My research interests have never been limited to a single subfield or theoretical approach. In fact, that's what drew me to language research in the first place; anytime you're ever learning about anything, there's language involved<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ineffable">...more or less.</a></p>

<p>In graduate school, I was influenced heavily by a quote that I can never find the source of; the way I always recite it is this, and it's how I try to live:</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p>Language documentation is too valuable to waste on linguists alone.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="things-i-tend-to-think-about"><em>Things I tend to think about</em></h3>

<p>I have written on and consulted about a variety of topics in linguistics. The list below ought to give an idea of the range of my interests and what I've been thinking about recently.</p>

<h2 id="miami-illinois-language-reclamation">Miami-Illinois Language Reclamation</h2>

<p>At any given moment, I have several short- and long-term research projects in progress focusing on various aspects of what scholars call the
<strong>Miami-Illinois language</strong> ‚Äî Miami-Illinois is an academic cover term for the languages spoken by Miami, Wea, Peoria, Kaskaskia, and other related groups of people in the southern Great Lakes region.</p>

<p>Today, most myaamia speakers refer to their language as <a href="/wiki/myaamiaataweenki">myaamiaataweenki</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/pano-miamiok.jpg" width="2937" height="1097" alt="Miami Nation Dance Grounds, Miami, Oklahoma" title="Miami Nation Dance Grounds, Miami, Oklahoma" class="rounded" /></p>

<h3 id="ilda-https-ilaatawaakani-org"><a href="https://ilaatawaakani.org"><em>ILDA</em></a></h3>

<p>Language projects often resemble what <a href="https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jar/ILR/">Keren Rice (2009) called "the two solitudes"</a>. More recently, I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's Law</a>, which is the idea that organizations end up designing systems that reflect their own communication patterns.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ilaatawaakani.org/">ILDA</a> platform unifies the analytical and pedagogical functions by recognizing them as distinct; it was built from the ground up with and for both user groups in mind. Data from the primary sources and secondary sources flow together to present information that is useful to different user groups.</p>

<p>It was originally designed specifically for the Myaamia Center's use case, e.g. easily making available annotations from manuscripts like <a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/documents/19">Jean-Antoine Robert LeBoullenger's</a> 18th century Miami-Illinois dictionary to today's team of speaker-learner-teachers</p>

<p>ILDA now can handle audio/video files marked up by <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan">ELAN</a> and is regularly used by Native American tribal language programs across the country for precisely this purpose.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="nisinoon-https-nisinoon-net"><a href="https://nisinoon.net/">Nisinoon</a></h2>

<p>Algonquian languages are known for complex words with many meaningful parts. Linguists typically divide these into three primary <a href="/wiki/word-guts.html">components</a>: an initial, a medial, and a final.</p>

<p><a href="https://nisinoon.net/"><strong>Nisinoon</strong></a> is <a href="https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/main-entry/nisinoon-vii">an Ojibwe word</a> that means <em>they are three; there are three of them</em></p>

<p>As part of an NSF-Funded grant project, my former dissertation advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Macaulay">Dr. Monica Macaulay</a> and I are working with <a href="https://danielhieber.info/">Dr. Daniel Hieber</a> to create <a href="https://nisinoon.net">nisinoon</a>, a tool to explore the structures of words in Algonquian languages.</p>

<p>Along the way, we created other resources like a <a href="https://nisinoon.net/bibliography">bibliography of Algonquian morphology</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ojibwe-potawatomi">Ojibwe-Potawatomi</h2>

<p>Ojibwe-Potawatomi is an academic cover term for a large group of varieties spoken on the northern Great Lakes region. For various analytical and ideological reasons, many of these languages either are or were sometimes known as "dialects of Ojibwe". Such appellations are imprecise and outdated.</p>

<p>My dissertation was a descriptive grammar of Potawatomi, marking the culmination of almost a decade of work with and for Anishinaabe people from different communities across the Three Fires but especially the Forest County Potawatomi Community.</p>

<p>It was designed to accompany the Forest County Potawatomi Dictionary <a href="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2018-06/potawatomi_documentation_lexical_database_and_dictionary.pdf">(<code>grant pdf</code>)</a>, which I also helped to compile, and contains a few stories that were collected as part of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1263888">corpus project</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-myaamiaataweenki-miami-illinois">What is the difference between <em>myaamiaataweenki</em> &amp; <em>Miami-Illinois</em>?</h2>

<p>Miami-Illinois is what I call an <em>academic cover term</em> - it is a term that scholars use to refer to a lot of different groups of people, without being specific. It's very useful, sometimes, to have generic words!</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p>Today, most speakers of the language call it <a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/dictionary/entries/6648">myaamiaataweenki</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what I've written about the language, check out <a href="/about/selected-writings.html">some of my writings</a>!</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ceeki≈°i-iilaataweenkia-https-mc-miamioh-edu-ilda-myaamia-phrases-443757-all-kinds-of-languages"><a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/phrases/443757">ceeki≈°i iilaataweenkia</a> <em>'all kinds of languages'</em></h3>

<p>What are the <a href="/wiki/word-guts.html">components (or "word guts")</a> of the word <em>myaaamiaataweenki</em>?</p>

<p>Obviously, <strong>myaamia</strong> is the name of the people. But how does the other part mean 'language'?</p>

<p><strong>-aatawee</strong> is a verb component. We sometimes call it a <em>no-object verb</em>, because, well, it doesn't take an object! (linguists would say it is <em>intransitive</em>)! When this piece appears in a word, it means 'speak a language', so we can use all the ordinary verb endings like <strong>myaamiaataweewaaci</strong> <em>they speak/are speaking the myaamia language</em>.</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p>That leaves <code>-(e)nki</code>, which is a <em>suffix (ending)</em> on no-object verbs that takes the subject away!</p>

<p>It's sort of like the verb <em>speak</em> &amp; the noun <em>speech</em> in English...</p>

<p>But it's more similar to Spanish sentences like <em>se habla Espa√±ol</em> <em>Spanish is spoken</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selection of my academic work is given below. I have given each work listed here a subjective rating of how relevant it might be to the sort of language learner who finds themselves reading linguistics papers. The rating scale is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>üò¥ Marginal</code> indicates that the work focuses on a language other than myaamiaataweenki or is very technical.

<ul>
<li>This could be relevant to something you're interested in, but it might be in an indirect way or as background information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>ü¶ß Low</code> indicates the work might be about multiple Algonquian languages or be focused on questions that aren't very relevant to most people.

<ul>
<li>It will be easier to get some value out of reading this, if you're only interested in myaamiaataweenki, but it might not be the most useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>üéØ High</code> indicates the work is primarily about myaamiaataweenki or otherwise has a lot of examples that could be useful to ordinary people.

<ul>
<li>These I hope readers can get use out of without knowing or caring about any of the linguistics.</li>

As far as I know, this was a teaching method that she did not widely publish, but some of the (now-deceased) Potawatomi elders were still cheerfully remembering and using this strategy decades later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A] circle was drawn for most sentences and the audience was asked to state the obviative within that message.<br />

<h2 id="summary-table">Summary Table</h2>

<p>Here's a table, showing the different forms in myaamiaataweenki.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Meaning</th>
  <th><code>[proximate]</code></th>
  <th><code>[obviative]</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/dictionary/entries/3083">üêï</a></td>
  <td><strong>alemwa</strong></td>
  <td><strong>alemwali</strong> or <strong>alemooli</strong></td>

<tr>

  <td><strong>alemwaki</strong></td>
  <td><strong>alemwahi</strong> or <strong>alemoohi</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In some of the Algonquian languages, there are no obviative plurals anymore. But <a href="/wiki/myaamiaataweenki">myaamiaataweenki</a> still has them!</p>

<hr />

<p>...so how do they work? What do you do with them?</p>

<h2 id="using-obviative-and-proximate-in-conversation">Using Obviative and Proximate in Conversation</h2>

<p>That's where the circle comes in! There can only be <em>one</em> (1) proximate in a sentence; all other animates have to be obviative.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: <em>conversations and stories aren't limitless</em>. We can only keep track of so many things at one time.</p>

<p>So to help us keep track of what we're talking about, imagine a circle. The circle has just enough room for me/us (<code>1st person</code>), you/y'all (<code>2nd person</code>), and one other animate noun (<code>3rd person</code>) .</p>

<p>The 3rd person you decide to bring into the circle is <code>proximate</code>. All the rest, the ones you leave out, are <code>obviative</code>.</p>

<p>But don't take my word for it...</p>

<h3 id="examples-from-speakers">Examples from speakers</h3>

<p>Compare this sentence, where <strong>alemooki</strong> is the only one in the circle...</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p><strong>neehi <em>alemooki</em> meeki≈°iweeciki</strong></p>

<p>'and dogs bark'
<a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/phrases/11828">Trowbridge 367-13-1</a></p>
</div>

<p>...with this next one, where there's not enough room in the circle for everyone. The speaker who LeBoullenger recorded 400 years ago decided to leave <strong><a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/dictionary/entries/3308">kwaahkwaanihsia</a></strong> 'grasshopper' out, and make it an obviative:</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p><strong><em>kwaahkwaanihsiahi</em> eemwaaci</strong></p>

<p>'he eats grasshoppers'
<a href="https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/phrases/271948">LeBoullenger 376-56-1</a></p>
</div>

<p>The grasshoppers don't fit in the circle, because the person doing the eating is the one we're talking about, and he's already there!</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>You might not use it right now, but this ending gets used in the stories a lot...because most of the time you have to talk about more than two people to tell a story!</p>

<p>So if you haven't heard it yet or seen it before, keep your eyes and ears open - I bet you'll run into it soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)">Obsidian</a>, of course; I actually had a paid subscription for it, but I ended up wanting something sleeker and more minimal,</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>When I was helping put together the <a href="/about/research.html">Forest County Potawatomi Dictionary</a>, we spent a lot of time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalinguistics">talking about language</a>, and Lindsay Marean, a Potawatomi woman who at the time was a linguist and is now also a programmer, shared a story with me about using the term <em>verb guts</em> with the elders and others when trying to talk about what linguists call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation"><em>derivational morphology</em></a>, the study of meaningful sub-components of words.</p>

<p>I adapted this, here and elsewhere, extending it to <strong>word guts</strong>, for the simple reason that nouns also have guts!</p>

<h3 id="why-word-guts.html">Why <em>Word Guts</em>?</h3>

<p>Linguists sometimes talk about or display language in ways that community members find objectionable. Unusable language will be presented alongside impenetrable theoretical jargon.</p>

<p>People who study Ojibwe have been talking about this for a long time; that's why Rand Valentine's <em>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</em>, for instance, displays example sentences without "cutting up" words.</p>

<p>But linguists like me still need to study these building blocks of words in order to understand the language better. The solution I try to follow is to be sure to present full, usable language alongside segmented, unpronounceable pieces (in my memory, credit for this idea goes to Wes Leonard, but I can't find a reference to it, offhand...).</p>

<h2 id="what-are-word-guts.html">What are <em>Word Guts</em>?</h2>

<p>Living things like humans are made up of internal organs; when separated from each other, neither of us can survive. We may look simple, on the outside, but internally, we are complex.</p>

<p>Living words are like this, too! Words are made up of smaller parts that, when separated from each other, don't make any sense &amp; can't survive.</p>

<div class="notice1">
<p>A <em>language</em> is a <em>type of knowledge</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>But instead of internal organs, linguists who study Algonquian languages like myaamiaataweenki and Bodw√©wadmimwen sometimes say that words are made up of <em>components</em>. Components are the smallest parts of a word that do or mean something. Together, they make up the stable body of the word, which I call the <em>base</em> or the <em>stem</em>.</p>

<p>A language is a type of knowledge. Fluent speakers know and recognize thousands of different components of words! They use that knowledge to combine words in novel ways and to understand words they've never heard before.</p>]]></content:encoded>
